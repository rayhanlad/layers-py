Reproduce a deep learning framework just using numpy and some basic Python framework.
Implementation of the forward pass, gradient and backward pass for classical layers as Dense, CNN or Recurrent.

In construction...

To do:
 1. CNN Layers (backward).
 2. RNN Layers (forward and backward pass)
 3. Add SoftMax loss (and other fancy losses...)
 4. Complete the activations (Add LeakyReLU, and others...)
 5. Find a clever implementation of the Optimizer class.
 6. Documentation
 7. Implement Pooling layer
 8. Implement Dropout layer.
